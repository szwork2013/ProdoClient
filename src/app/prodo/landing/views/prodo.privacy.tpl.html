<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Information Collected Upon Registration:</h5>When you create or reconfigure a Prodonus account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do not require registration.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Information:</h5>You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may use your manage accounts to unsubscribe from notifications from Prodonus. You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. We may use your contact information to help others find your Prodonus account, including through third-party services and client applications. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your Prodonus account to your account on another service in order to cross-post between Prodonus and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Prodonus within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Prodonus your account on the other service. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Product Comments, Warranty Comments, Blogs Information:</h5>Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information about products with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you post and the metadata provided with each post, the products you follow, recommend products, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Prodonus. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your public user profile information and public product or warranty comments may be searchable by search engines. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Location Information:</h5>You may choose to publish your location in your comments and in your Prodonus profile. You may also tell us your location when you set your trend location on www.prodonus.com or enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as posting comment with your location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies:</h5>Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Prodonus may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.
<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Log Data:</h5> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Prodonus account to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Prodonus button or widget. Prodonus uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 12 months.

<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Business Transfers:</h5>In the event that Prodonus is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
